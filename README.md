# Fullwidth

An app to generate ｆｕｌｌｗｉｄｔｈ ｔｅｘｔ.
(c) 2017 and forward, Gatlin Johnson <gatlin@niltag.net>.

Built with [react-native][reactnative]. Never actually tested it on an iOS
device so *caveat emptor*.

# Usage and screenshots

## Step 1: Type some text

Type text you want to aestheticize and gaze in awe as it is converted *in real time*.

## Step 2: Long press the big yellow area

The text will be copied to your clipboard. Whoa!
